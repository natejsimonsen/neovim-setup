# Setup
Ensure node is installed and a version of >= 14 is available. In the .chadrc files ensure these variables are installed on the correct path.

On MacOS this will look like:
"path/to/node",
"/Users/userName/.local/share/nvim/mason/bin/language-server",

On Linux figure it out :). guessing that you use linux I'm already confident you are smart enough to do this.

On Windows good luck you probably should just switch to Linux ;).
